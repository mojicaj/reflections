When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    if working from different computers or with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    so you can control what gets changed and when and can handle them
    accordingly

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: clone of repo stored/created on GitHub; copy repo to make own version
    clones: copy of repo stored on GitHub, copied locally; copy repo to sync local changes
    branches: copy of repo created inside the repo; work on changes within repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
